The error message:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'selenium'
means that Python can’t find the Selenium library on your system.

Here’s how to fix it:

🧩 Step 1: Install Selenium
Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run:

pip install selenium
If you’re using Python 3 specifically, you may need:

pip3 install selenium
🧠 Step 2: Verify the Installation
Check if Selenium installed correctly:

python -m pip show selenium
If it prints version info, it’s installed successfully.

⚙️ Step 3: Ensure You’re Using the Right Environment
If you have multiple Python environments (e.g., venv, Anaconda, etc.), you may have installed Selenium in the wrong one.

You can verify which Python your script is using:

which python
(on macOS/Linux) or:

where python
(on Windows)

Then make sure to install Selenium for that exact Python:

/path/to/python -m pip install selenium
🧪 Step 4: Run the Script Again
Once installed, try running:

python /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
If you’d like, I can also help you verify whether your system has pip correctly configured or guide you to install a compatible WebDriver (like ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver) — Selenium needs that too. Would you like me to walk you through that next?

Perfect — that message is from Debian-based systems (like Raspberry Pi OS) which now protect the system Python from global package installs.
You have three safe ways to fix this 👇

🧩 Option 1: Use the system package (Recommended)
The simplest and safest way:

sudo apt install python3-selenium -y
✅ This installs Selenium from the official Raspberry Pi/Debian repositories.
Then run your script again:

python3 /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
🧰 Option 2: Use a Virtual Environment (Best for development)
If you want full control and to install newer versions of Selenium:

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv ~/selenium_env

# Activate it
source ~/selenium_env/bin/activate

# Install Selenium inside it
pip install selenium
Now you can run your script inside this environment:

python /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
When you’re done, deactivate the environment:

deactivate
⚡ Option 3: Override the protection (not recommended)
If you really want to install globally (not advised):

pip install selenium --break-system-packages
⚠️ This may break system tools or other Python apps on your Pi. Use only if you know what you’re doing.

✅ Best choice:
For simplicity — run:

sudo apt install python3-selenium
Would you like me to also show how to install the browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver) needed for Selenium to actually open browsers on the Raspberry Pi?

You said:
i want the raspberry pi to run the following script on boot
python /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — there are a few reliable ways to make your Raspberry Pi automatically run a Python script at boot, but I’ll show you the best and cleanest method for your use case (graphical Selenium script with fullscreen browser).

🧠 Step 1: Verify your script runs correctly
Before automating startup, test it manually:

python /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
Once it works (opens the browser fullscreen etc.), proceed.

⚙️ Step 2: Create a systemd service
This method is reliable, runs even when no one is logged in, and can automatically restart if it crashes.

Open a terminal and create a new service file:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mediboard.service
Paste the following content:

[Unit]
Description=Mediboard fullscreen launcher
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=wealth
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
WorkingDirectory=/home/wealth/Downloads
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
Environment=XAUTHORITY=/home/wealth/.Xauthority
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical.target
⚠️ Make sure /usr/bin/python3 points to the correct Python path:
You can confirm with which python3.

Save and exit:

Press Ctrl + O, then Enter, then Ctrl + X.

🚀 Step 3: Enable the service to run at boot
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable mediboard.service
Now test it immediately without rebooting:

sudo systemctl start mediboard.service
Check status (optional):

sudo systemctl status mediboard.service
🔁 Step 4: Reboot to confirm
sudo reboot
After reboot, your script should automatically start and launch Selenium in fullscreen.

🧹 Optional: Stop or disable later
If you ever need to stop it:

sudo systemctl stop mediboard.service
Or disable from auto-start:

sudo systemctl disable mediboard.service
Would you like the script to run only after you log in to the desktop (instead of before login)?
If so, I can show the simpler .desktop autostart method too.

i need this entire session to be writen as a procedure guide and be writen as a document 
ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here’s a clear, step-by-step procedure guide you can save or share.

Procedure Guide: Setting Up Mediboard Script on Raspberry Pi
Objective
To configure a Raspberry Pi to automatically launch the Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py Python script on system boot using systemd.

1. Verify the Script Works Manually
Before automating, confirm the script runs correctly.

python3 /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
If Selenium or other dependencies are missing, install them as described below.

2. Install Selenium
If you receive:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'selenium'
install Selenium using the appropriate method for Raspberry Pi OS (Debian).

Option A – Install via apt (Recommended)
sudo apt install python3-selenium -y
Option B – Install in a Virtual Environment (For Developers)
python3 -m venv ~/selenium_env
source ~/selenium_env/bin/activate
pip install selenium
python /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
deactivate
⚠️ Avoid using --break-system-packages unless absolutely necessary.

3. Create a systemd Service
Systemd lets your script run automatically on boot and restart if it crashes.

Create the service file

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mediboard.service
Paste this configuration

[Unit]
Description=Mediboard Fullscreen Launcher
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=wealth
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
WorkingDirectory=/home/wealth/Downloads
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
Environment=XAUTHORITY=/home/wealth/.Xauthority
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical.target
Confirm the Python path with:

which python3
Save and exit

Press Ctrl + O, Enter, then Ctrl + X.

4. Enable and Start the Service
Reload systemd and enable auto-start:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable mediboard.service
Start immediately (without reboot):

sudo systemctl start mediboard.service
Check status:

sudo systemctl status mediboard.service
5. Reboot to Verify
Reboot the Raspberry Pi:

sudo reboot
After startup, the Mediboard script should launch automatically in fullscreen mode.

6. Manage the Service
Action	Command
Stop service	sudo systemctl stop mediboard.service
Restart service	sudo systemctl restart mediboard.service
Disable autostart	sudo systemctl disable mediboard.service
View logs	journalctl -u mediboard.service -f
7. Optional: Autostart After Login (Graphical Desktop Only)
If you prefer the script to start after login rather than at system boot:

mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
nano ~/.config/autostart/mediboard.desktop
Paste this:

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Mediboard
Exec=python3 /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
Save, exit, and it will launch when you log into the desktop.

Summary
✅ Installed Selenium safely
✅ Created and enabled a systemd service
✅ Verified script launches at boot
✅ Provided optional desktop autostart method

how do i exit to page 
ChatGPT said:
If by “exit to page” you mean leaving the current command-line or terminal session on your Raspberry Pi and going back to the desktop (GUI) screen, here’s what you can do — depending on your setup 👇

🧭 If you’re in a terminal window inside the desktop environment
You can simply:

Close the terminal window (click the ❌ button), or

Type:

exit
and press Enter — this will close the terminal session.

💻 If you’re using the full-screen terminal (text-only mode) (e.g. after pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1–F6)
You can return to the graphical desktop (the one with your browser and icons) by pressing:

Ctrl + Alt + F7
or sometimes:

Ctrl + Alt + F1
(depending on your Raspberry Pi OS version).

🪟 If you’re using SSH from another computer
Just type:

exit
and press Enter to return to your own machine’s terminal.

Would you like me to explain how to make your script automatically open in fullscreen on the desktop after boot (not just run in background)?

how do i open a script from desktop
ChatGPT said:
Good question 👍 — there are a few ways to open and run a Python script directly from your Raspberry Pi desktop, depending on whether you want to edit it or run it.

Here’s the full guide 👇

🧩 1. Open the Script to Edit It
If you just want to see or edit your script (for example Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py):

Option A – Use Thonny (built-in editor)
On the Raspberry Pi desktop, click the Raspberry menu (top-left).

Go to Programming → Thonny Python IDE.

In Thonny, click File → Open.

Navigate to:

/home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
Click Open.

You can now view or edit the code and press Run ▶ to execute it.

Option B – Use a Text Editor
Right-click your .py file on the desktop or in the file manager → Open With → Text Editor.
This opens it for editing (no execution).

⚙️ 2. Run the Script from the Desktop
If you want to launch the Python script by double-clicking it:

Option A – Make It Executable
Right-click your .py file → Properties → Permissions tab.

Check “Allow executing file as program.”

Close the dialog.

Now double-click the file → when asked, choose “Execute”.

💡 If it opens in a text editor instead, you can change that behavior:

Open File Manager → Edit → Preferences → General

Under “Executable Text Files”, choose “Ask what to do” or “Execute the file.”

Option B – Run it via Terminal
Right-click the desktop → Open Terminal.

Type:

python3 /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
Press Enter.

This directly runs the script in a terminal window.

Option C – Create a Desktop Shortcut
If you want a one-click launcher:

Open a terminal and create a .desktop file:

nano ~/Desktop/Mediboard.desktop
Paste:

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Mediboard Launcher
Exec=python3 /home/wealth/Downloads/Mediboard_raspberry_with_fullCreen.py
Icon=python
Terminal=true
Save (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

Then make it executable:

chmod +x ~/Desktop/Mediboard.desktop
Now you’ll see a new icon on your desktop — double-click it to run your script!

Would you like the launcher version to run in the background (no terminal showing) or open with a visible terminal window? I can show you the version for whichever you prefer.

how do i stop daemon from running
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question — stopping a daemon (like your Mediboard systemd service) is straightforward. Here's exactly how to do it 👇

🧩 1. Stop the Service Immediately
This stops it right now (until reboot or manual restart):

sudo systemctl stop mediboard.service
After this, your script (and the browser it opened) should close if it was still running.

⚙️ 2. Disable It from Starting on Boot
If you want to prevent it from starting automatically when the Raspberry Pi boots:

sudo systemctl disable mediboard.service
This keeps it stopped even after a reboot.

🔍 3. Check Its Status
You can verify whether it’s running, stopped, or disabled:

sudo systemctl status mediboard.service
You’ll see something like:

● mediboard.service - Mediboard Fullscreen Launcher
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/mediboard.service; disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)
✅ means running
❌ or “inactive (dead)” means stopped.

🧹 4. (Optional) Remove the Service Completely
If you no longer want it at all:

sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/mediboard.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
This deletes the service definition so it can’t be started accidentally.

🧠 Summary
Action	Command
Stop now	sudo systemctl stop mediboard.service
Prevent from boot	sudo systemctl disable mediboard.service
Check status	sudo systemctl status mediboard.service
Remove permanently	sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/mediboard.service + sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Would you like to keep it installed but only start it manually when you want (like an on-demand script)? I can show you the safest way to do that next.

You said:
how do i close the service and go to the desktop
ChatGPT said:
Good question 👍 — here’s exactly how to stop your Mediboard service (daemon) and return to your Raspberry Pi desktop (GUI) safely.

🧩 Step 1: Stop the Service
Open a terminal (or press Ctrl + Alt + T) and type:

sudo systemctl stop mediboard.service
✅ This immediately closes the running service — which should stop the Python script and close the fullscreen browser Selenium opened.

You can verify it stopped with:

sudo systemctl status mediboard.service
If you see:

Active: inactive (dead)
then it’s no longer running.

⚙️ Step 2: Return to the Desktop (Graphical Mode)
🖥️ If you’re in the graphical environment (LXDE or Raspberry Pi Desktop)
You’re already there — just close the terminal window.

You can also switch between windows with:

Alt + Tab
💻 If you’re in text-only mode (black screen, no GUI)
Press:

Ctrl + Alt + F7
or on some versions:

Ctrl + Alt + F1
That switches you back to the desktop interface.

🧠 Tip: Ctrl + Alt + F2 through F6 open additional text consoles.
Ctrl + Alt + F7 (or F1) brings you back to the desktop (X session).

🧹 Step 3: (Optional) Prevent It from Starting Automatically
If you don’t want it to auto-start again on boot:

sudo systemctl disable mediboard.service
You can always re-enable it later with:

sudo systemctl enable mediboard.service
✅ Summary

Task	Command
Stop the service now	sudo systemctl stop mediboard.service
Check if stopped	sudo systemctl status mediboard.service
Go back to desktop	Ctrl + Alt + F7 (or F1)
Disable autostart	sudo systemctl disable mediboard.service
Would you like me to give you a quick command to make sure the browser window (from Selenium) also closes automatically when you stop the service?
